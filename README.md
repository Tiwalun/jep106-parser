# jep106 Parser

This crate contains a helper binary to parse the JEP106 code definitions from the PDF provided by the JEDEC association.

If you want to get the manufacturer name from a JEP106 code, use the [jep106](https://crates.io/crates/jep106) crate,
which used the parsed definitions from this crate.
